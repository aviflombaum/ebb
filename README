Ebb Web Server

= Design

The design is similar to the Evented Mongrel web server; except instead of
using EventMachine (a ruby binding to libevent), the Ebb web server is written
in C and uses the libev event loop library (http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html).

Connections are processed as follows:

1. libev loops and waits for incoming connections.

2. When Ebb can read from a client socket, it passes the buffer into the
   mongrel state machine which parses the headers into name value pairs. 

3. Ebb starts passes the request information and peer socket to a user
   supplied callback. 

4. The included Ruby binding, supplying this callback transforms the request
   into a Rack compatible "env" variable and passes it on a Rack adapter.

Because Ebb is written entirely in C, other language bindings can be added to
make it useful to Non-Ruby frameworks. For example a Python WSGI interface is
forthcoming.

Ebb aims to be the smallest and fastest web server possible specifically for
doing the processing for web frameworks like Rails. 

It's less than 1000 lines of C code!

= TODO, ordered
* Put client's address into env
* Log levels
* Option to listen on unix sockets instead of tcp
* Python binding
* Better build system - using scon (http://www.scons.org/)? 
  Not autoconf.
