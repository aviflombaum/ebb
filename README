# A Web Server Called *Ebb*

Ebb aims to be a small and fast web server specifically for hosting 
dynamic Ruby language web applications. 

It is basically a binding to [libebb](http://tinyclouds.org/libebb)

## Install

The Ruby binding is available as a Ruby Gem. It can be install by executing

    gem install ebb

If you want SSL support you must install GnuTLS.
Ebb has no other dependencies.

## Running

Using the executable `ebb_rails` one can start Ebb with a Rails project. Use
`ebb_rails -h` to see all of the options but to start one can try

    cd my_rails_project/
    ebb_rails start

When using `ebb_rails` from monit, the monitrc entry might look like this:

    check process myApp4000
      with pidfile /home/webuser/myApp/current/tmp/ebb.4000.pid
      start program = "/usr/bin/ruby /usr/bin/ebb_rails start -d -e production -p 4000 -P /home/webuser/myApp/current/tmp/ebb.4000.pid -c /home/webuser/myApp/current" as uid webuser and gid webuser
      stop program = "/usr/bin/ruby /usr/bin/ebb_rails stop -P /home/webuser/myApp/current/tmp/ebb.4000.pid" as uid webuser and gid webuser
      if totalmem > 120.0 MB for 2 cycles then restart
      if loadavg(5min) greater than 10 for 8 cycles then restart
      group myApp

To use Ebb with a different framework you will have to do a small amount of
hacking at the moment! :)

## Speed

Because Ebb handles most of the processing in C, it is able to do work
often times more efficiently than other Ruby language web servers.

Ebb-Ruby can handle threaded processing better than the other 'evented' 
servers. This won't be of any benefit to Rails applications because Rails
places a lock around each request that wouldn't allow concurrent processing
anyway. In Merb, for example, Ebb's thread handling will allow Ebb instances
to handle larger loads. [More](http://four.livejournal.com/848525.html)

## Contributions

Contributions (patches, criticism, advice) are very welcome! 
Please send all to to 
[the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ebbebb).

The source code is hosted [github](http://github.com/ry/ebb/tree/master). It
can be retrieved by executing

    git clone git://github.com/ry/ebb.git

Here are some features that I would like to add:
* HTTP 1.1 Expect/Continue (RFC 2616, sections 8.2.3 and 10.1.1)
* A parser for multipart/form-data (only for optimization - this functionality is currently handled at the framework level)
* Python binding
